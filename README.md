# ASL-Image-Classifier
This repository contains code for training and evaluating a deep learning model to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) gestures. The code is written in Python using popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. The ASL dataset used in this project includes hand gesture images representing three different signs: 'A', 'B', and 'C'.
